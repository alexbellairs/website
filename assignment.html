        <p>Q1.  Describe the purpose of using IT in creating your website and how you will use IT to plan and carry out the necessary tasks? 
            <br>
            <p class="gametext2">I will use IT while creating my website to input information, links, picture and videos as well as hyperlinks. The website I've created is aimed at people who wuld like to get to know me a little better.</p>
            <br>
            Q2.  Describe methods, skills and resources needed to complete your website - explain what IT systems and software applications you need to be successful in your website project, and how you will use them (Describe at least one method, skill and resource needed to complete your website)
            <br>
            <p class="gametext2">The website has been created using, html code and css for styling. It is made up of text, images and video as well as including links to a few various websites and social media to contact the creator. Resources used include google, slides from CODENATION and graphic design.</p>
            <br>
            Q3.  Describe the legal guidelines and risks that might impact your website project - how does GDPR and copyright affect website development?
            <br>
            <p class="gametext2">Because of GDPR and copyright laws, when creating a website you have to make sure you have the legal right to use any images, videos and logos you wish to put onto your website, and the GDPR laws mean you can't give out any contact information or collect contact information without the said persons permision.</p>
            <br>
            Q4.  Review the ongoing use of IT tools you have used for your website and describe whether they are appropriate - what are the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used? (Are you happy with the tools you used?)
            <br>
            <p class="gametext2">I have used html and CSS to create this website, the benefits to html are it is quite simple to use and good for getting information onto the site. CSS is great for styling and personalising the site. There are drawbacks to both, the bigest being the vast arays of different tools, skills and styles etc. that are around therefore me not knowing everything meaning a lack of knowledge is my biggest drawback. Overall though I'm happy with the tools and skills I've learnt so far.</p>
            <br>
            Q5.  Describe how you would test your website to make sure it looks as intended. What kind of files have you used in your website and explain why you have chosen those filetypes. How can you test your website to ensure it is accessible to people with disabilities? Describe how you can overcome potential accessibility issues with your website 
            <br>
            <p class="gametext2">To test your webiste you open the file in folder and run it through your browser, this gives you a live look at how your website would look. The files I have used include png, jpeg, jpg and mp4. In terms of making accessible, you want to make sure all the text is a good size and easily readable and add alternate descriptions to images and videos so if someone is using a reader to view your website they can be told what everything is. Alongside that you could make a version in black an white for colour blind users. It would also be beneficial to include warnigs before entry of the site if you have things such as flashing images.</p>
            <br>
            Q6.  Describe ways to improve your productivity and efficiency throughout this project (how can you make sure you are using IT tools and systems in the most effective way?) If you could have been more productive or efficient, how would you implement this for a future project?
            <br>
            <p class="gametext2">I feel like my productivity was pretty good for this project, but a couple of ways I feel like I could of improved would be to have had more of a struced plan to follow at the begining and also to of done more research on my own to put different ideas into it.</p>
            <br>
            Q7.  Describe the final version of your website (what is the content and layout for each page?), assess the strengths and weaknesses and describe further improvements you can make to your website. Is the website fit for purpose? (did you achieve what you set out to do in your plan?)
            <br>
            <p class="gametext2">My final version of the website has 5 different pages to it, firstly it has the ome page with a welcome and  brief introduction to the site and myself, secondly it has an about me age giving information about me both professionally and personally, thirdly it has a contact me page with links to various ways to get in contact with me. Penultimately it has a page displaying the python game we made in the second week f the coures. And Finally i has a page wh the assignment questions and answers on.</p>
            <p class="gametext2">I think the website is fit for purpose and results in what I set out to achieve, of course there are always things I could improve, the CSS and HTML code is still quite basic and the overal display could be improved slightly but I feel like that would come with more experience nd knowledge gained over time.</p>
            <br>
            Q8.  Take a screenshot of your website homepage working in two different browsers. (Make sure the GitHub Pages link is visible in the screenshot).
